# ReferenceAnalysis-Develoment

## Purpose 

The purpose of the Referene Analysis is to quantify changes in our assumed physics reach as we update our reconstruction and/or simulation code.

It provides a simple cross-check, and also a place to exercise our analysis toolkit.

## Analysis Strategy

Scripts associated with development of the Mu2e Reference Analysis

* ReferenceAna - this runs roofit on standard ntuple (currently TrkAna) output on Mu2e machines;
* StatsTool-CutNCount - this will priovide a simplistic cut-and-count analysis - currently a set of python scripts interfaced to pyROOT.
